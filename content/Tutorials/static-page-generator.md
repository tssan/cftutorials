# Prerequisites

Pelican is a static site generator created in Python programming language. So the main requirement is Python language. For this tutorial I'm using Linux based operating system that have Python already installed. Some basic knowledge of how to use terminal will help you but even if you are new to that I will try to write down every command that will be required to complete this tutorial.


> For Windows users I recommend creating virtual machine using virtualbox or WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux in Windows 10).


After Pelican is installed user can jump right into writting articles and other content. For that any text editor will suffice. I'm using Sublime Text editor.

Customazing blog appearance require knowledge abut **HTML** and **CSS**. Pelican has build in templates system that can be also used to change blog layout and styles. There are ready to use themes for Pelican. (link)
